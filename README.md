# EasyRead

A UNICEF Office of Innovation prototype application that converts complex documents into accessible "easy read" format with simplified text and relevant images.

## Overview

EasyRead uses AI to process PDFs, generate simplified content, and match sentences with appropriate images through vector similarity search. Built for accessibility and evaluation purposes.

## Key Features

- PDF to accessible format conversion using AI
- Automated image selection from symbol libraries
- Content revision and editing capabilities
- DOCX export

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django REST API, PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Frontend**: React + Vite, Material-UI
- **AI Services**: OpenAI, Cohere, AWS Bedrock (via LiteLLM)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension
- API keys: OpenAI, Cohere, or AWS Bedrock

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
   - Database credentials
   - AI provider API keys
   - CORS and security settings

3. Start with Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Or run locally:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Configuration Required

You must provide your own:
- **API Keys**: OpenAI, Cohere, or AWS Bedrock credentials
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector (SQLite not supported)
- **Image Library**: GlobalSymbols images or your own symbol set
- **Django Secret Key**: Generate a secure key for production

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed setup and deployment instructions.
